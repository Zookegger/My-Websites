                Kevin Conroy was more than just a voice actor—he was the definitive voice of Batman for generations of
                fans. Born on November 30, 1955, in Westbury, New York, Conroy brought depth, gravitas, and humanity to
                the Caped Crusader, making the character his own in a way that resonated with audiences worldwide.
                <br><br>

                Conroy's journey as Batman began in 1992 with Batman: The Animated Series, a groundbreaking show that
                redefined superhero storytelling. His portrayal of Bruce Wayne and Batman was unparalleled, capturing
                the duality of the character—the brooding intensity of the Dark Knight and the charismatic charm of the
                billionaire playboy. His voice became synonymous with Batman, earning him a place in the hearts of fans
                and solidifying his legacy as one of the greatest interpreters of the character.<br><br>

                Over the years, Conroy lent his iconic voice to numerous projects, including Justice League, Justice
                League Unlimited, Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, Batman: Arkham video games, and many more. His work
                transcended the screen, inspiring countless fans and influencing future portrayals of Batman.<br><br>

                Beyond his work as Batman, Conroy was a talented stage and screen actor, with a career that spanned
                theater, television, and film. He was also an advocate for the LGBTQ+ community, openly sharing his
                experiences as a gay man and using his platform to promote acceptance and equality.<br><br>

                Kevin Conroy passed away on November 10, 2022, leaving behind a legacy that will endure for generations.
                His voice will forever echo in the halls of Gotham, reminding us why Batman is not just a hero, but a
                symbol of hope, justice, and resilience.<br><br>

                    — Kevin Conroy, Batman: The Animated Series</span><br>

                <span class="appreciation">Thank you, Kevin, for giving us the Batman we needed—and the one we
                    deserved.</span>
