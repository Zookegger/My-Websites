        <p>
            Dear Eileen,<br>
            <br>
            Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University 
            of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year.
            I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections
        </p>
        <div>
            <h2>Starting dates</h2>
            <p>
                We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with uus at any
                time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning 
                of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
                <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
                <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>

            <p>You can find more information about <a href="http://example.com">important university dates</a> on our website.</p>

            <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
            <p>
                At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research 
                facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science 
                and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, 
                and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that,
                of the ideas you submitted as we were most intrigued by are as follows, 
                in order of piority: 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).</li>
                <li>
                    Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures 
                    exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases 
                    (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>).
                </li>
                <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, 
                including how long you'd expect the research to take, 
                required staff and other resources, 
                and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
            </p>

            <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
            <p>
                Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. 
                To answer your question, my favorite dances are as follows, with definitions:
            </p>
            <div>
                Polynesian chicken dance <br>
                <div style="margin-left: 35px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
                    A little known but <i>very</i> influentital dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village 
                    would dance around in a cirlcle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".
                </div> 
                Icelandic brownian shuffle
                <div style="margin-left: 35px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
                    Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, 
                    which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around
                    in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought
                    this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.
                </div> 
                Arctic robot dance
                <div style="margin-left: 35px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
                    An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have 
                    discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilled movements, being practiced by inhabitants
                    of Northen Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like 
                    this because they were really cold.
