            Summer is a time for adventure, and this year has no exception. 
            I had many exciting experiences, but two of my favorites were my trip 
            to the beach and my week at summer camp.

            At the beach, I spent my days swimmingm collecting shells, 
            and building sandcastles. I also went on a boat ride and 
            saw dolphins swimming alongside us.
